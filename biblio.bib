@article{Greenland2015,
	abstract = {Penalization is a very general method of stabilizing or regularizing estimates, which has both frequentist and Bayesian rationales. We consider some questions that arise when considering alternative penalties for logistic regression and related models. The most widely programmed penalty appears to be the Firth small-sample bias-reduction method (albeit with small differences among implementations and the results they provide), which corresponds to using the log density of the Jeffreys invariant prior distribution as a penalty function. The latter representation raises some serious contextual objections to the Firth reduction, which also apply to alternative penalties based on t-distributions (including Cauchy priors). Taking simplicity of implementation and interpretation as our chief criteria, we propose that the log-F(1,1) prior provides a better default penalty than other proposals. Penalization based on more general log-F priors is trivial to implement and facilitates mean-squared error reduction and sensitivity analyses of penalty strength by varying the number of prior degrees of freedom. We caution however against penalization of intercepts, which are unduly sensitive to covariate coding and design idiosyncrasies.},

Both sampling-based algorithms (importance sampling, MCMC and SMC) and fast approximations (Laplace, VB and EP) are covered.

@article{Ghosh2018,
	abstract = {In logistic regression, separation occurs when a linear combination of the predictors can perfectly classify part or all of the observations in the sample, and as a result, finite maximum likelihood estimates of the regression coefficients do not exist. Gelman et al. (2008) recommended independent Cauchy distribu- tions as default priors for the regression coefficients in logistic regression, even in the case of separation, and reported posterior modes in their analyses. As the mean does not exist for the Cauchy prior, a natural question is whether the pos- terior means of the regression coefficients exist under separation. We prove theo- rems that provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of posterior means under independent Cauchy priors for the logit link and a general family of link functions, including the probit link. We also study the existence of posterior means under multivariate Cauchy priors. For full Bayesian inference, we develop a Gibbs sampler based on PÂ´olya-Gamma data augmentation to sample from the posterior distribution under independent Student-t priors including Cauchy priors, and provide a companion R package tglm, available at CRAN. We demonstrate empirically that even when the posterior means of the regression coefficients exist under separation, the magnitude of the posterior samples for Cauchy priors may be unusually large, and the corresponding Gibbs sampler shows extremely slow mixing. While alternative algorithms such as the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) in Stan can greatly improve mixing, in order to resolve the issue of extremely heavy tailed posteriors for Cauchy priors under separation, one would need to consider lighter tailed priors such as normal priors or Student-t priors with degrees of freedom larger than one.},

@article{Gelman2008,
	abstract = {We propose a new prior distribution for classical (nonhierarchical) logistic regression models, constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, and then placing independent Student-t prior distributions on the coefficients. As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of separation or monotone likelihood is observed in the fitting process of a logistic model if the likelihood converges while at least one parameter estimate diverges to $\pm$ infinity. Separation primarily occurs in small samples with several unbalanced and highly predictive risk factors. A procedure by Firth originally developed to reduce the bias of maximum likelihood estimates is shown to provide an ideal solution to separation. It produces finite parameter estimates by means of penalized maximum likelihood estimation. Corresponding Wald tests and confidence intervals are available but it is shown that penalized likelihood ratio tests and profile penalized likelihood confidence intervals are often preferable. The clear advantage of the procedure over previous options of analysis is impressively demonstrated by the statistical analysis of two cancer studies.

Here a more general family of bias-reducing adjustments is developed for a broad class of univariate and multivariate generalized nonlinear models. The resulting formulae for the adjusted score vector are computationally convenient, and in univariate models they directly suggest implementation through an iterative scheme of data adjustment.

The class of models includes logistic regression, where the Jeffreys-prior penalty is known additionally to reduce the asymptotic bias of the maximum likelihood estimator, and models with other commonly used link functions, such as probit and log-log. Shrinkage towards equiprobability across observations, relative to the maximum likelihood estimator, is established theoretically and studied through illustrative examples. Some implications of finiteness and shrinkage for inference are discussed, particularly when inference is based on Wald-type procedures. A widely applicable procedure is developed for computation of maximum penalized likelihood estimates, by using repeated maximum likelihood fits with iteratively adjusted binomial responses and totals. These theoretical results and methods underpin the increasingly widespread use of reduced-bias and similarly penalized binomial regression models in many applied fields.},

General expressions for the adjusted score functions are derived in terms of quantities that are readily available in standard software for fitting generalized linear models. The resulting estimating equations are solved using a unifying quasi-Fisher scoring algorithm that is shown to be equivalent to iteratively reweighted least squares with appropriately adjusted working variates. Formal links between the iterations for mean and median bias reduction are established. Core model invariance properties are used to develop a novel mixed adjustment strategy when the estimation of a dispersion parameter is necessary. It is also shown how median bias reduction in multinomial logistic regression can be done using the equivalent Poisson log-linear model. The estimates coming out from mean and median bias reduction are found to overcome practical issues related to infinite estimates that can occur with positive probability in generalized linear models with multinomial or discrete responses, and can result in valid inferences even in the presence of a high-dimensional nuisance parameter.},

@article{Clogg1991,
	abstract = {We describe methods used to create a new Census data base that can be used to study comparability of industry and occupation classification systems. This project represents the most extensive application of multiple imputation to date, and the modeling effort was considerable as well---hundreds of logistic regressions were estimated. One goal of this article is to summarize the strategies used in the project so that researchers can better understand how the new data bases were created. Another goal is to show how modifications of maximum likelihood methods were made for the modeling and imputation phases of the project. To multiply-impute 1980 census-comparable codes for industries and occupations in two 1970 census public-use samples, logistic regression models were estimated with flattening constants. For many of the regression models considered, the data were too sparse to support conventional maximum likelihood analysis, so some alternative had to be employed. These methods solve existence and related computational problems often encountered with maximum likelihood methods. Inferences pertaining to effects of predictor variables and inferences regarding predictions from logit models are also more satisfactory. The Bayesian strategy used in this project can be applied in other sparse-data settings where logistic regression is used because the approach can be implemented easily with any standard computer program for logit regression or log-linear analysis. {\textcopyright} 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{Durante2019,
	abstract = {Variational Bayes (VB) is a common strategy for approximate Bayesian inference, but simple methods are only available for specific classes of models including, in particular, representations having conditionally conjugate constructions within an exponential family. Models with logit components are an apparently notable exception to this class, due to the absence of conjugacy among the logistic likelihood and the Gaussian priors for the coefficients in the linear predictor. To facilitate approximate inference within this widely used class of models, Jaakkola and Jordan (Stat. Comput. 10 (2000) 25-37) proposed a simple variational approach which relies on a family of tangent quadratic lower bounds of the logistic log-likelihood, thus restoring conjugacy between these approximate bounds and the Gaussian priors. This strategy is still implemented successfully, but few attempts have been made to formally understand the reasons underlying its excellent performance. Following a review on VB for logistic models, we cover this gap by providing a formal connection between the above bound and a recent P{\'{o}}lya-gamma data augmentation for logistic regression. Such a result places the computational methods associated with the aforementioned bounds within the framework of variational inference for conditionally conjugate exponential family models, thereby allowing recent advances for this class to be inherited also by the methods relying on Jaakkola and Jordan (Stat. Comput. 10 (2000) 25-37).},

@article{Chen2003,
	abstract = {We propose a novel class of conjugate priors for the family of generalized linear models. Properties of the priors are investigated in detail and elicitation issues are examined. We establish theorems characterizing the propriety and existence of moments of the priors under various settings, examine asymptotic properties of the priors, and investigate the relationship to normal priors. Our approach is based on the notion of specifying a prior prediction y0 for the response vector of the current study, and a scalar precision parameter a0 which quantifies one's prior belief in y0. Then (y0, a0), along with the covariate matrix X of the current study, are used to specify the conjugate prior for the regression coefficients $\beta$ in a generalized linear model. We examine properties of the prior for a0 fixed and for a0 random, and study elicitation strategies for (y0,a0) in detail. We also study generalized linear models with an unknown dispersion parameter. An example is given to demonstrate the properties of the prior and the resulting posterior.},
