# Bias reduction methods for logistic regression
This repository is associated with the article "Rigon, Aliverti (2022). Conjugate priors and bias reduction for logistic regression models", and contains code implementing bias-reduction via
Diaconis-Ylvisaker conjugate prior and tutorials reproducing the results of the article.

- [ENDOMETRIAL](./ENDOMETRIAL) focuses on the `endometrial` dataset studied in Heinze and Schemper (2002, Stat. in Med.) and contains code to reproduce results from Secion 4.1 of the paper
- [BIRTHWEIGHT](./BIRTHWEIGHT) focuses on the `birthweight` dataset available in the `MASS` pacakge, and contains code to reproduce results from Secion 4.2 of the paper. 
- [HIGH-DIMENSIONAL](./HIGH-DIMENSIONAL) focuses on a high-dimensional setting with moderately large $n$ and $p$
